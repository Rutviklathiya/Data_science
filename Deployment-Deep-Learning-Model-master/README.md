# Deployment-Deep-Learning-Model
This project wil help to classify that wheather the chest X-ray is normal or it contains pnuemonia.
The data is collected from the kaggle and the dataset link is https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia and I ahve applied the VGG16 Pretrained deep neural network for this project.
To Download the given model 'model_vgg19.h5' download that model through this link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ud4L8cBmxnc4TZp6xclH6OyEMNCKIfx1  as Training will require vast time hence for simplicity i saved this trained model.
and set the path of downloaded model in app.py file.
